<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a No-Code Push GitHub web application. The core workflow is:
1.  Users create an account and authenticate with a Git provider.
2.  Users drag and drop files.
3.  An AI service analyzes the files to automatically organize them, generate a , , , and .
4.  The backend uses the user's credentials to create and push to a new Git repository.
5.  The user is notified with a link to the new repository.

The scope has since expanded to include a full V1 REST API, multiple Git providers, a credit-based billing system, autopush features, a White Paper page, a Pro user dashboard, and a full admin dashboard for application management.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in French. The next agent **MUST** respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) project, but both remain largely monolithic (, ).
-   **Frontend ()**: This file is critically oversized, containing the logic for almost the entire application: Landing Page, User Dashboard, Pricing, White Paper, Account, and the Login Modal.
-   **New Frontend Pages ()**: A separate file was created for the new Admin section, which includes a dedicated login page () and an admin dashboard ().
-   **Pro Dashboard ()**: A new Pro dashboard has been created, accessible from the main user dashboard. It displays advanced (though mostly mocked) analytics and features promised on the pricing page.
-   **Backend ()**: The backend has been extended with a full set of admin-only API endpoints to manage users and jobs. The core user-facing logic remains largely the same. Email/password authentication has been removed from the UI but the backend endpoint still exists for admin login.
-   **Admin Account**: An admin account is automatically created or updated on backend startup with credentials from  ( / ).

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested to add a button on the **landing page header** that navigates to the new Pro Dashboard (). The agent started by examining the  page component inside .
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. After adding the button, use the screenshot tool to verify its presence and appearance on the landing page.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Bug in Admin User List API (P1)**
-   **Issue 2: GitHub OAuth Configuration Error (P2)**
-   **Issue 3: Full end-to-end Git workflow is untested. (P2)**
-   **Issue 4: Non-GitHub OAuth providers are not implemented. (P3)**

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description**: The  endpoint returns a 500 Internal Server Error. This happens because the Pydantic model  uses  for validation, which fails on some auto-generated GitHub user emails ending in . This breaks the Users tab in the admin dashboard.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The issue was identified by inspecting logs, but no fix was attempted.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  In , locate the  Pydantic model.
        2.  Change the type of the  field from  to  to bypass the strict validation.
        3.  Restart the backend if necessary.
        4.  Test the fix by accessing the  page and checking if the user list loads correctly.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fixing this will make the Users tab of the admin dashboard functional, allowing the admin to view and manage users.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend (via curl or by checking the admin UI).
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
-   **Issue 2:**
    -   **Description**: The user reported that GitHub login shows an error: The redirect_uri is not associated with this application. The agent diagnosed this as a configuration mismatch between the  in  and the authorized callback URLs in the user's GitHub OAuth App settings.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent provided instructions to the user on how to update the callback URL in their GitHub Developer settings. The fix is pending user action.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: Await user confirmation. If the issue persists, verify the exact URL in  and ask the user to double-check their GitHub settings.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will restore the primary login method for the application.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED (on user action)
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (by attempting to log in with GitHub).
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
-   **Issue 3:**
    -   **Description:** The application's core feature—uploading files, AI processing, and pushing to a new GitHub repository—has been implemented but never tested from start to finish.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
-   **Issue 4:**
    -   **Description:** The UI allows selecting providers like GitLab and Bitbucket, but the backend lacks the necessary OAuth implementation for them.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Add Pro Dashboard button to Landing Page Header (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** Modify the  component in . Add a button to the header that uses . The button should only be visible if a user token is present, as the Pro dashboard is a protected route.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** Fulfills the user's request for easier access to the Pro dashboard directly from the main page for logged-in users.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P1) Refactor :** The monolithic  is now extremely large and fragile. It is critical to break it down into smaller, manageable component files (e.g., , ).
    -   **(P1) Refactor :** Decompose the monolithic backend file into modular FastAPI  files for better maintainability.
    -   **(P2) Implement Real Billing:** Replace the mock Stripe billing logic with a real integration.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **(P2) Implement Backend Logic for Project Management:** The Archive and Delete buttons in the dashboard UI call placeholder functions. Backend endpoints and logic need to be created.
    -   **(P2) Implement Pro Dashboard Features:** Implement the backend logic for the mocked features on the Pro dashboard (Autopush, Webhooks, Partner API).
    -   **(P3) Enhance Admin Dashboard:** Add filtering, searching, and pagination to the user and job lists.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Admin System Created**:
    -   Added dedicated  page and  dashboard.
    -   Implemented backend endpoints to list users/jobs and update user plans/credits ().
    -   The admin dashboard allows viewing all jobs and managing user plans and credit balances.
-   **Pro Dashboard Created**:
    -   Built a new Pro dashboard at  to display advanced analytics and promised Pro features (mostly mocked).
    -   Added a Mode Pro button to the user dashboard header to navigate to .
-   **UI/UX Enhancements**:
    -   Removed email/password login forms from the UI to focus solely on OAuth providers.
    -   Updated the White Paper page by removing sections and linking a CTA button to the pricing page.
    -   Made the site-wide logo clickable, redirecting to the landing page from all main pages.
    -   Improved styling of various buttons (GitHub login, Back buttons, other OAuth provider buttons) with neon effects, shadows, and icons.
    -   Made feature cards on the landing page interactive.
    -   Applied the landing page's background gradient to the user dashboard for a consistent look.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (via ), Pydantic, JWT
-   **Architecture:** The monolithic architecture (, ) remains a significant technical debt, made more acute by the addition of more pages and logic into .
-   **Admin Access**: A basic RBAC is implemented with an  flag in the user model and a separate  stored in  to manage admin sessions.

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: {, , ,  (new), , , ...}
-   **projects**: {, , , , ...}
-   **jobs**: {, , , , ...}

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files**
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Massively modified to add the Pro Dashboard logic, routing for admin pages, and dozens of UI/UX tweaks across all existing pages.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Modified to add the admin authentication check and all new  endpoints.
-   **/app/frontend/src/AdminPages.jsx**: New file created to contain the  and  components.
-   **/app/backend/admin_routes_notes.txt**: Supporting document with notes on admin routes.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **CRITICAL:** . This file is unsustainable. It must be broken down into a proper page/component structure. The agent started this by creating , but the rest of the app (Landing, Dashboard, Pro Dashboard, Pricing, Account, Whitepaper) is still in .
-   **HIGH PRIORITY:** . It should be broken down into logical modules using FastAPI's  (e.g., , , ).

**key api endpoints**
-   : Used for admin email/password login.
-   : Checks if the current user token belongs to an admin.
-   : (CURRENTLY BROKEN) Lists all users.
-   : Lists all jobs.
-   : Updates a specific user's plan and/or credits.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   You **MUST** respond to the user in French.
-   Your immediate task is to add a button to the landing page header for accessing the Pro Dashboard (). This button should likely only be visible for logged-in users.
-   After that, the most critical issue to address is the broken  endpoint, which prevents the admin from seeing the user list. The fix is straightforward (see ).
-   You **MUST** propose refactoring  and  after completing the user's immediate requests. The technical debt is becoming a major risk to development speed and stability.
-   The user may report that GitHub login is broken. This is a configuration issue on their side; refer to  for the explanation you should provide.
